# ToDo-List
Visit the site: https://secret-waters-89630.herokuapp.com/ 

A basic day-to-day life site.
Made with simple frontend and backend.

Basically made for using to write an individual day needs whether it may be for doing any stuff like buying various things to make list of daily routine.
It can also be used for office work you have to do on that day.

It is made by using HTML, Css and Javascript in frontend.
For backend, I have used Node.js, express and Ejs. For, stored Database using Mongoose and mongo.

If you have to try to run this code by yourself then just download the files. 
Do the following steps:

Open hyper Terminal and change directory to the folder where files are stored.

Then, write the command: npm install express ejs body-parser 

Then, for using database just type the command: npm install mongoose.

As we have also used lodash so to install for the current type: npm install lodash

And then try to run on the localhost 3000 for which you have to make changes to app.js where on last in case of port replace it with 3000,and delete let port commands.

for running on localhost just use , node app.js or nodemon app.js .
